# Journey_To_El_Dorado
A repo for my adventure game. Taking place in South America, you play as a traveler wandering from town to town in exile from their hometown for crimes unknown. Upon entering a new, mysterious town, rumors spread of a city made entirely out of gold and has an abundance in precious stones. This piques the curiosity of the wandering traveler and sparks an idea on how to end their exile to go back home. You begin to gather information on where this city resides and how to get there safely. Dodging sketchy situations and persevering against any odds, you set off on a journey to El Dorado.
